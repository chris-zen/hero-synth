# hero-synth

The goal of this project is to create an audio synthesizer that is able to model Additive, Substractive and FM synthesis all in one. The idea is to add some basic units such as oscilators, LFOs, evelopes, filters and effects, and allow the user to route them using a kind of [matrix mixer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mixer).

Before you continue looking at it, please bear in mind that my main motivation with this project is to learn the Rust language.

Some ideas for the future are to work on an Audio Unit/VST interface so it can be used with music studios such as Garage Band or Cubase.
